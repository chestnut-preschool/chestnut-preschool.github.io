    <p>Our goal at Chestnut Memorial Preschool is to provide each student with an excellent foundation for learning.</p>
    <p><br />Your child is very important to us! We realize that each child is a unique individual full of potential and ready to learn. At Chestnut, the children learn while they are having fun with a curriculum designed to prepare them for future learning and the exciting life ahead of them. Through a variety of activities, they will develop not only academic skills, but a belief in themselves, respect for others, good work habits and an eagerness to learn.</p>
    <p><br />Preschool will give your child the opportunity to become a member of a group where they will learn to share materials, toys and adult attention. The ability to do these things will help your child make an easy transition to other learning environments.</p>
    <p><br />Our teachers at Chestnut are simply the best! They understand the needs of preschool children and how they learn best. With warmth, affection and a nurturing heart, they will help your child develop the many skills necessary to be successful not only this year, but in the future.</p>
    <p><br />The Chestnut Preschool family consists of a supportive school board and a quality teaching staff. This professional group of individuals is responsible for what we believe is a superb program here at Chestnut Memorial Preschool.</p>
    <p><br />Susan Egyud, Director</p>
    <p>Christine Cole, Assistant Director</p>
